# ai-land-optimization-website
A self-developed frontend project that simulates an AI-powered platform to suggest the best use of a land parcel â€” whether for agriculture, building a home, opening a shop, or selling. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with map integration and a fully responsive UI. Designed and developed entirely through self-learning by Mohamed Mahshoq MS.
