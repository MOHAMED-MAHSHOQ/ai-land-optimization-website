🧠 AI Land Optimization Webpage

A self-developed, beginner-friendly frontend project that allows users to explore multiple potential uses for their land — whether it's for agriculture, building a shop, constructing a home, or selling. Built entirely by Mohamed Mahshoq MS using core web technologies and real-world creativity.


🌍 Project Overview

This website simulates an AI-assisted land decision platform, helping users visualize and choose the best utilization of their land. Though it’s frontend-only, it represents a powerful idea of AI-backed land optimization for modern use cases.

Created as part of my self-learning journey, this project demonstrates my growing skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design thinking, and user interface development.
